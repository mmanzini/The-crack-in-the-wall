Silently padding through hollow walls and dusty attics, **Whisperlings** are the secretive listeners and lore-keepers of the small folk. They earned their name because they always seem to know the house's secrets — catching murmurs through vents, learning human routines, trading in rumours with other small folk.

Physically, whisperlings are slight, pale or grey-skinned with large light-sensitive eyes adapted to darkness. They dress in mottled tones of cobweb, cloth scrap and ink, helping them blend into shadows. Culturally, they are cautious and clever: a Whisperling community might live behind the walls of an old house library, holding whispered council by candlelight and venturing out only when the floorboards cease creaking above.

Of all small folk, whisperlings have the strongest taboo about being seen — they treat it almost as a sin, training their young to freeze at the slightest hint of human gaze. In compensation, they are generous with information and warnings, often sending messengers in secret to help others avoid danger (for a price or favour, of course).

**Shadowmeld** — When in dim light or darkness and not under direct human observation, a Whisperling gains a **+1 Boon on stealth checks** by default. Their very skin and hair seem to dim and blur into the background.

**Keen Eavesdropper** — Their large ears and attunement to vibrations grant them a **+1 Boon on listening tests**. A Whisperling can hear conversations through walls if within a few inches of them.

**Frail Frame** — Physically less robust, Whisperlings suffer a **Bane on saves against strong winds or being carried off** by larger creatures — they're light enough that even a housecat's pounce can send them tumbling. However, their reflexes are sharp, granting them a **Boon on DEX saves to avoid traps or falling objects**.

## Roles

Whisperlings have two primary callings: the **Echo-Walker** and the **Shadow-Teller**.

---

## Echo-Walker

*The scout, infiltrator, and master of sonic trickery.*

Echo-Walkers pad silently through the voids between walls, acting as spies and messengers between small folk enclaves. They earned the title because they not only move quietly, but can *walk echoes* — imitating and throwing sounds to mislead or distract foes.

Mechanically, the Echo-Walker is a **rogue or ranger at micro-scale**, excelling at sneaking and confusing enemies. They rely on DEX for agility and INT for clever tactics, and often impose *Distracted* or *Vulnerable* conditions on targets by cunning maneuvers.

## Shadow-Teller

*The storyteller, lore-keeper, and bard of the hidden world.*

Shadow-Tellers are the keepers of small folk history, weaving tales from the darkness to inspire, protect, and enchant. Where Echo-Walkers use stealth for survival, Shadow-Tellers use *story* — they know that a well-told tale can calm a frightened ally, charm a suspicious enemy, or reveal a truth hidden for generations.

Mechanically, the Shadow-Teller is a **support and control class**, relying on WIL for social influence and INT for lore. They buff allies, charm enemies, and manipulate the narrative of encounters.

<strong>Tales of Old & Ghostly Whispers</strong>
<p>You know small folk folktales and a smattering of "words of power" — spoken phrases that carry minor magical weight.

</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 2</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Hearth Light</strong>
<p>You carry a tiny lantern or candle imbued with protective magic. While it's lit and on your person, you and nearby allies within 2 spaces gain a <strong>+1 Boon on WIL saves</strong> against fear and despair. As an action you can dim it to a faint glow that only small folk can see.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 3</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Shadow Play (Action, 1/encounter)</strong>

<strong>Attribute Improvement</strong>
<p>Increase WIL or INT by +1. Additionally, choose one of: (a) your voice can carry a calming or frightening tone as a free action once per scene, or (b) you learn to read the emotional resonance of places — you can sense the strongest emotion that occurred in a room in the past day.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 5</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Lullaby of the Crickets (Action, 1/day)</strong>
<p>You sing a gentle, hypnotic lullaby. All creatures within 6 spaces who can hear must make a WIL save.

The lullaby ends immediately if anyone makes noise or attacks.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 6</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Binding Words (Action)</strong>
<p>Your voice carries magical authority. Choose one creature within 6 spaces that can understand you. They must make a WIL save or be <strong>Compelled</strong> to follow one simple instruction (no more than a sentence, nothing suicidal). Effect lasts until they complete the instruction or take damage.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 7</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Umbral Covenant</strong>
<p>You have made a pact with the shadows themselves. Once per day, you can enter a shadow and emerge from any other shadow within 20 spaces (as if teleporting). While inside a shadow, you are immune to mundane detection for up to 1 minute. You also gain a permanent Boon on all WIL saves.</p>

<strong>Sanctuary of Story (Passive)</strong>
<p>When you begin a Safe Rest and spend 10 minutes telling a calming tale or soothing song, all heroes present heal an additional 1 Wound (in addition to the standard 1 Wound from the Safe Rest). This benefit applies once per Safe Rest.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 10</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Master Shadow-Teller</strong>
<p>Your words can reshape reality in the hidden world. Once per session you can declare a <em>True Tale</em> — a statement about a fact in the hidden world. If it could plausibly be true, it <em>becomes</em> true within the scope of your current location (a secret door exists; a creature hesitates; a danger is averted). The GM has final say on scope, but should lean toward granting it for narrative richness.</p>
