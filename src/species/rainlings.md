**Rainlings** are small folk deeply attuned to water, rain, and the hidden network of gutters, drains, and puddles that connects the whole neighbourhood. They are quick, adaptable, and magically tied to precipitation — when it rains, Rainlings feel it in their blood, a surge of energy and possibility.

Physically, Rainlings are sleek and slender, with slightly iridescent skin that catches light like a wet stone. Their hair tends toward dark blues and greens, and their fingers are slightly webbed — excellent for gripping slick surfaces. They blink sideways, giving them a distinctly amphibious look.

Culturally, Rainlings are divided between those who embrace the open sky (Raincallers, who work weather magic openly and feel called to adventure) and those who prefer the hidden underground of pipes and storm drains (Gutter Runners, who use their water connection for speed, stealth, and infiltration).

**Waterborn** — Rainlings can breathe underwater and swim at their full Speed. They are immune to the *Soaked* condition and never suffer Banes from rain, wet surfaces, or water-based hazards.

**Rain Sense** — When precipitation occurs nearby (even light drizzle), Rainlings can sense it instinctively before it arrives. They gain a **+1 Boon on Initiative** when it is currently raining or has rained in the last hour.

**Slick Skin** — Rainlings are very hard to grab. They gain a **+1 Boon on saves against being Grappled or Restrained**. They can squeeze through openings slightly smaller than their body with ease.

**Puddle Step** — Once per day, as an action, a Rainling can step into any puddle or body of water and emerge from any other puddle or water body they know within 30 spaces. The destination must have been visited before.

## Roles

Rainlings have two fully detailed roles.

<img src="/assets/images/species/raincaller.png" alt="A Raincaller summoning rain" class="role-image">

## Raincaller

*The weather mage who summons storm, rain, and lightning.*

Raincallers are the most overtly magical of the Rainlings, dedicating their lives to studying rain and the tiny storms they can conjure. They are equal parts healer and warrior — a Raincaller's magic can soothe injuries and grow plants, or lash out with focused lightning and battering hail.

Mechanically, Raincallers are a **support/control caster**, relying on WIL for magical power and DEX for mobility.

## Gutter Runner

*The swift infiltrator who uses water as their personal highway.*

Gutter Runners are the Rainlings who have gone underground — literally. Where Raincallers call the sky, Gutter Runners command the pipes, drains, and damp hidden passages that run beneath the neighbourhood. They are fast, stealthy, and surprisingly deadly in close quarters, treating every puddle as a door and every pipe as a corridor.

Mechanically, Gutter Runners are a **skirmisher/rogue**, relying on DEX for speed and precision.

### Class features (Levels 1–10)

<ul class="level-list">

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 1</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Shadow Crawler</strong>
<p>You are at home in darkness and cramped quarters. Gain +1 Boon on stealth checks in dim light or darkness, and you can move through spaces half your size without penalty. Wet or damp environments grant you an additional +1 Boon to stealth (stacking).</p>
</div>
</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 2</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Puddle Jump (Action)</strong>
<p>Step into one puddle and emerge from another. As an action, you can teleport from any wet surface (puddle, damp stone, recent rain) to any other wet surface you've visited within 20 spaces. The departure and arrival are silent. Can be used in combat.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 3</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Flowing Strike</strong>
<p>Movement and attack flow together. When you move at least 3 spaces before attacking, your attack deals +1d4 bonus damage. If you also came from a wet surface or are Soaked, the attack additionally imposes the <strong>Pushed</strong> effect (target is moved 1 space back) on a hit.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 4</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Rain Cloak</strong>
<p>When rain is falling (natural or magical), you can <strong>vanish from sight</strong> as a free action. You become effectively invisible while moving through rain (creatures must succeed on a INT check with Bane to detect you). This ends if you attack or stop moving for a full round.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 5</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Torrent Rush (Action, 1/encounter)</strong>
<p>Channel the surging energy of flowing water into a burst of speed. As an action, you move up to 3× your Speed in a straight line. This movement does not provoke Opportunity Attacks. If you end this movement adjacent to an enemy, they must make a STR save or be knocked Prone.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 6</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Relentless Onslaught</strong>
<p>When you use an action to Attack, you can make one additional attack as part of the same action (instead of spending another action). This extra attack is still rushed. Once per turn.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 7</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Lightning Reflexes</strong>
<p>You gain a permanent Boon on Initiative rolls. Additionally, once per round, you can take a reaction without spending an action from your current turn (the first such reaction each round is free). This does not stack with itself — you still can only take each reaction type once per round.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 8</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Evasive Drizzle (Reaction)</strong>
<p>You've become a master at slipping through danger. When forced to make a DEX save, you can spend 1 action to automatically succeed on the save, taking no damage or effect. Alternatively, if an attack would hit you, you can spend 1 action to make the attacker reroll once, taking the lower result.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 9</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>Secret Paths (Passive)</strong>
<p>You've traversed the entire micro-world neighbourhood and learned every hidden route, shortcut, and secret way. You can move through any structure you've been in before at double speed (ignoring difficult terrain). Once per day, you can lead your entire party through a "secret path" that effectively bypasses one obstacle or locked location — you know a way through that no one else has found.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li class="level-item">
<span class="level-num">Level 10</span>
<div class="level-content">
<strong>King of Shadows</strong>
<p>You have become the ultimate shadow of the hidden world — part water, part darkness, part unstoppable force. You gain all of the following: permanent +1 Boon on stealth, attacks, and DEX saves; Puddle Jump's range increases to any wet surface you've ever seen (no distance limit within the neighbourhood); your attacks ignore Medium armour; and once per encounter you can take 2 full turns in a row by spending 3 actions from your reserve.</p>
