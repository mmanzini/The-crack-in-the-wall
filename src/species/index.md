In The Crack in the Wall, a hero's origin **species is their class**. Each species has unique racial traits and two distinct role variants that serve as subclasses. All members of a species share common abilities, but each individual trains in one of two ways.

All small folk heroes use the same attribute system (STR, DEX, INT, WIL) and Boon/Bane mechanics for tests.

## Choosing your species

**Whisperlings** are for players who love stealth, information, and playing the clever trickster. They're physically frail but mentally sharp.

**Wayfarers** are for players who love shapeshifting and spirit bonds — versatile and mystical, always on the move.

**Shellbacks** are for players who want to be the reliable defender, absorbing punishment and protecting allies.

**Rainlings** are for players who want magic woven into everything they do — combat, movement, even how they hide.

**Veilings** are for players who love illusions, secrets, and the eerie side of the hidden world.
