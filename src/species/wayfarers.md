Ever wandering and curious, **Wayfarers** are the nomads and free spirits of the small folk, often found in gardens, gutters, and the open sky, riding wayward breezes on dandelion seeds. They are also sometimes called **Driftlings** in older small folk tongue.

Physically, wayfarers are lean and wiry, with colourful hair often dyed with berry juice or pollen. They possess gliding membranes or frills between their limbs that allow them to drift remarkable distances on air currents. Their eyes reflect starlight strangely, hinting at their connection to the night sky.

Culturally, wayfarers are explorers and traders who never settle in one wall crack for long. A wayfarer family might migrate from one backyard to another with the seasons, their homes strapped to their backs in tiny rolled packs.

## Spirit Patronage

Central to wayfarer culture is the practice of **Spirit Patronage**. Wayfarers can create magical contracts with powerful spirit patrons, often animal spirits connected to the natural world. Each pact grants the wayfarer access to a magical **transformation token** — a tiny berry or seed that grows in hidden or enchanted places.

When consumed, the berry allows the wayfarer to **partially or fully transform** into the patron's form for a time. A pact with a sparrow spirit might let them sprout small wings and glide; a fox spirit pact might grant sharper senses and cunning reflexes.

The transformation typically lasts from a few minutes to an hour, depending on the potency of the berry and the strength of the bond. Overuse can exhaust the wayfarer or strain the pact.

**Glide and Soar** — Wayfarers can glide gracefully from heights. When a wayfarer falls any distance, they can spread their "wings" to glide, taking no falling damage and drifting horizontally up to 2 spaces per space fallen.

**Wind Whisperer** — Wayfarers have a knack for sensing weather and wind changes. They gain a **+1 Boon** on checks related to navigation, weather prediction, or noticing incoming environmental threats.

**Spirit Patronage (Dream Contracts)** — All wayfarers have the innate ability to forge contracts with spirit patrons through dreamwalking. A wayfarer may maintain a number of patron contracts equal to their level ÷ 3 (minimum 1). See the Stargazer class for full patron rules.

**Nomadic Resilience** — Having lived outdoors and traveled far, wayfarers are tougher than whisperlings. They have advantage on saves against environmental hazards (temperature, weather, altitude, hunger) and difficult terrain rarely slows them on paths they've traveled before.

## Roles

Wayfarers have one fully detailed role and a second that is still in development.

## Stargazer

*The shaman who forges pacts with multiple spirit patrons and carries their essences in magical transformation tokens.*

Personality-wise, Stargazers are wise yet restless, carrying the accumulated knowledge of their many journeys and the responsibilities of their patron contracts. They often serve as spiritual leaders within their nomadic clans, guiding migrations by the stars and brokering peace between competing spirit territories.

Mechanically, Stargazers are **versatile shapeshifters** who rely on **WIL** for maintaining patron relationships and **DEX** or **STR** for combat effectiveness in their transformed states.
