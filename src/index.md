subtitle: A kids-friendly tabletop RPG about tiny folk living hidden in our world

A quiet suburban neighbourhood block is, to its tiniest denizens, an **entire continent of mystery**.

In this whimsical yet dark world, insect-sized humanoids known as the **Small Folk** live hidden in our homes, gardens, and walls. A flower bed becomes an enchanted forest. A single backyard spans kingdoms. The gap behind a skirting board conceals an entire village.

The mood balances **wonder with mystery** — reminiscent of *Coraline* or *The Borrowers* in atmosphere. Every cozy hideaway has its lurking secrets, and even friendly scenes can turn unsettling when the lights go out.

## Mechanics at a glance

- **Roll tests** with multiple dice, keep the highest (Boon) or lowest (Bane)
- **Combat** rolls deal damage — attacks only miss on a natural 1
- **Grit** — earn it on bad rolls, spend it to improve future odds
- **The Law of Witness** — a human's direct gaze collapses magic
- **3 actions per turn**, with reactions costing actions
